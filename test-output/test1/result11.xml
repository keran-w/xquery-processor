    <LINE>Your brother too must die; consent you, Lepidus?</LINE>
    <LINE>Prick him down, Antony.</LINE>
    <LINE>Or here, or at the Capitol.</LINE>
    <LINE>So you thought him;</LINE>
    <LINE>And took his voice who should be prick'd to die,</LINE>
    <LINE>In our black sentence and proscription.</LINE>
    <LINE>You may do your will;</LINE>
    <LINE>But he's a tried and valiant soldier.</LINE>
    <LINE>Let us do so: for we are at the stake,</LINE>
    <LINE>And bay'd about with many enemies;</LINE>
    <LINE>And some that smile have in their hearts, I fear,</LINE>
    <LINE>Millions of mischiefs.</LINE>
    <LINE>Now, Antony, our hopes are answered:</LINE>
    <LINE>You said the enemy would not come down,</LINE>
    <LINE>But keep the hills and upper regions;</LINE>
    <LINE>It proves not so: their battles are at hand;</LINE>
    <LINE>They mean to warn us at Philippi here,</LINE>
    <LINE>Answering before we do demand of them.</LINE>
    <LINE>Upon the right hand I; keep thou the left.</LINE>
    <LINE>I do not cross you; but I will do so.</LINE>
    <LINE>Mark Antony, shall we give sign of battle?</LINE>
    <LINE>Stir not until the signal.</LINE>
    <LINE>Not that we love words better, as you do.</LINE>
    <LINE>Come, come, the cause: if arguing make us sweat,</LINE>
    <LINE>The proof of it will turn to redder drops. Look;</LINE>
    <LINE>I draw a sword against conspirators;</LINE>
    <LINE>When think you that the sword goes up again?</LINE>
    <LINE>Never, till Caesar's three and thirty wounds</LINE>
    <LINE>Be well avenged; or till another Caesar</LINE>
    <LINE>Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors.</LINE>
    <LINE>So I hope;</LINE>
    <LINE>I was not born to die on Brutus' sword.</LINE>
    <LINE>Come, Antony, away!</LINE>
    <LINE>Defiance, traitors, hurl we in your teeth:</LINE>
    <LINE>If you dare fight to-day, come to the field;</LINE>
    <LINE>If not, when you have stomachs.</LINE>
    <LINE>What man is that?</LINE>
    <LINE>All that served Brutus, I will entertain them.</LINE>
    <LINE>Fellow, wilt thou bestow thy time with me?</LINE>
    <LINE>Do so, good Messala.</LINE>
    <LINE>According to his virtue let us use him,</LINE>
    <LINE>With all respect and rites of burial.</LINE>
    <LINE>Within my tent his bones to-night shall lie,</LINE>
    <LINE>Most like a soldier, order'd honourably.</LINE>
    <LINE>So call the field to rest; and let's away,</LINE>
    <LINE>To part the glories of this happy day.</LINE>
